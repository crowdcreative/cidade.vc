myCRED is an adaptive points management system that lets you award / charge your users for interacting with your WordPress powered website.

== Description ==
 
I felt that todays WordPress community lacks a flexible points management system. Existing system often feel restrictive, stale or lack support for popular plugins.

So I built an adaptive plugin which gives itâ€™s users full control on how points are awarded, used, traded, managed, logged and presented. Built on the "opt-in" principle, it is up to you what features you want to use and how. If your WordPress installation does not support a feature it is hidden from you to keep things clean and simple.

**my**CRED comes packed with features along with built-in support for some of the most popular WordPress plugins out there. But of course **my**CRED does not support everything out of the box so I have documented as much as possible in the **my**CRED codex and you can find several tutorials that can help you better acquaint yourself with **my**CRED.

I am here to help where ever I can but please remember that right now this is a one man show and I do need an occasional coffee break.

You are welcome to post your issues or questions under the "Support" tab but remember that  **my**CRED has it's own online forum along with [F.A.Q.](http://mycred.me/about/faq/) page and [Known Issues](http://mycred.me/download/known-issues/).

**Hooks**

**my**CRED hooks are instances where you award or deduct points from a user. By default you can award point for: registrations, logins, content publishing, commenting, clicking on links and viewing YouTube videos. You can find more information on built-in hooks [here](http://mycred.me/about/hooks/).


**Add-ons**

**my**CRED add-ons allows you to enable more complex features that is not just about awarding / deducting points. Features include: Sell Content with points, Buy points for real money, transfer points between users, award ranks according to points balances and expand **my**CRED to work with BuddyPress. You can find a complete list of built-in and premium add-ons [here](http://mycred.me/add-ons/).


**The Codex**

If you are comfortable with PHP or have some experience with customising your WordPress installation, I have documented as much as possible of **my**CRED in the [Codex](http://codex.mycred.me/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does myCRED support Multisite Installations? =

Yes, **my**CRED supports Multisite installations.

= Can my "Points" use decimals? =

Yes. When you run the **my**CRED Setup, you will be asked if you want to use whole numbers or decimals. However it should be noted that once the setup is completed, this can not be changed without first deleting **my**CRED though the 'Delete Plugin' function in WordPress (in other words, DO NOT delete the files using FTP).

= I want to charge a user for creating a group, can I disable group creation for users who does not have enough points? =

Yes. You can set a negative value for either "Creating Group" or "Joining Group" which will restrict a user from creating or joining any group unless they have enough points without going minus on their account.

= Some Hooks contain several instances where points might be given to users. Can I disable parts of them or do I have to use every instance? =

You can always disable parts of a hook by awarding zero points. Hooks that have zero points are ignored.

= Can I use the mycred_sell_this shortcode multiple times in a post?

Yes but if one of them is bought, all is shown. The mycred_sell_this shortcode was created so you can show "teaser" content before someone purchases the post / page / custom post type. It was not built to sell multiple items on a single page.
