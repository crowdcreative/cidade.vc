Increases Wordpress' default search functionality in three easy steps.


== Update ==

= Well, we tried... =

It took a few years of kick-starting the Search Everything Plus project and it being subverted by new full-time projects at Sprout Venture before realizing it had to stop. Our goal of fixing WordPress search with SE+ needed too much focus, something we couldn't sacrifice because of growing client projects. After a year of trying and nothing awesome to show we decided to cease all planning and development on the Search Everything Plus plugin/service. </p>

But our goal of fixing WordPress search isn't lost and we have <strong>two</strong> recomendations for you:</p>

[SearchWP](http://s-v.me/RgIu)
They claim it's the best search plugin around and we can't agree more. It's seriously close to what we had planned for SE+, in many ways it's much better than what we counted on accomplishing.</p>

[Swiftype Search plugin](http://s-v.me/Q8wb)
It replaces the standard WordPress search with a better, more relevant search engine, and in doing so offloads the performance burden of search queries from your database to theirs.</p>


The advantages of both should be clear but if you're undecided we recomend [SearchWP](http://s-v.me/RgIu) becuase of how it doesn't require a subscription.
